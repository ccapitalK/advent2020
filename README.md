# What is this

My solutions to Advent of Code 2020. I started with python on Linux, then switched over to c++2a on SerenityOS to test it as a developer environment. Do not read if you do not want them to be spoiled.

**Note:** SerenityOS was rapidly changing when I did this, code for certain days may depend on Libraries that have changed the time of writing, commits that were cherry-picked out of order or never even upstreamed, sometimes even
quick changes on my own fork that I never even committed. As a result, quite a few of these may not compile or may crash.
